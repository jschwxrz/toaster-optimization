# ToasterOptimization

Welcome to the ToasterOptimization repository! This repository contains a series of optimization challenges, ranging from easy to prepare to cry, all centered on the art of perfecting toaster settings. The various optimization tasks and the outline are detailed in `toaster_optimization_task.py`.

## Repository Structure

Each difficulty level of the toaster optimization tasks has its own dedicated folder. Inside these folders you'll find the files, where the filename indicates the type of algorithm that was used.

- A utility function.
- My implementation of an algorithm designed to maximize the utility function.

For the higher levels of difficulty, namely 'hard', 'very hard' and 'prepare to cry', you'll notice multiple Python files. This is because I explored several strategies in my quest for optimization. To share the full extent of my process:

- I included scripts that plot the utility function for a clearer visual understanding.

## Running the Code

To run any of the optimization scripts:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Change the directory to the folder of the desired difficulty level using `cd`.
3. Execute the script with the following command:

`python <filename>.py`

Feel free to delve into the folders, explore the various approaches, and see how the algorithms perform. Happy optimizing!
