# ToasterOptimization

Welcome to the ToasterOptimization repository! This repository is the home to a series of optimization challenges, ranging from easy to very hard, all centered on the art of perfecting toaster settings. Our journey is detailed in `toaster_optimization_task.py`.

## Repository Structure

Each difficulty level of the toaster optimization tasks has its own dedicated folder. Inside these folders, you'll find one or more Python files. These contain:

- A utility function specifically for that level of difficulty.
- My implementation of an algorithm designed to maximize the utility function's effectiveness.

For the higher levels of difficulty, namely 'hard' and 'very hard', you'll notice multiple Python files. This is because I explored several strategies in my quest for optimization. To share the full extent of my process:

- I included scripts that plot the utility function for a clearer visual understanding.
- I have also added my attempts at manually calculating the utility function's optimums to verify the accuracy of my algorithm.

## Running the Code

To run any of the optimization scripts:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Change the directory to the folder of the desired difficulty level using `cd`.
3. Execute the script with the following command:

python <filename.py>

Feel free to delve into the folders, explore the various approaches, and see how the algorithms perform. Happy optimizing!
