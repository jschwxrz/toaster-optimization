# ToasterOptimization

This repository contains the implementation of the easy, medium, hard and very hard level of the toaster optimization tasks, described in toaster_optimization_task.py.

Each level has it's own folder containing one or more python file/s with a version of toaster_optimization_task.py that only contains the utitlity function and my implemenation of an algorithm that optimizes the utility function.

In the case of the hard and very hard level, there are multiple files, since I tried different approaches. I also added some files to show my work, as a python file that plots the utility function or a file where I tried to calculate the optimums of the utitlity function myself, in order to find out if my algorithm was correct.

Each file can be executed by cd'ing into the directory and simply running python <filename.py>
