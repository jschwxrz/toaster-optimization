# ToasterOptimization

Welcome to the ToasterOptimization repository! This repository contains a series of optimization challenges, ranging from easy to prepare to cry, all centered on the art of perfecting toaster settings. The various optimization tasks and the project outline are detailed in `toaster_optimization_task.py`.

## Repository Structure

Each difficulty level of the toaster optimization tasks has its own dedicated folder. The folder contains one or multiple python files where the filename indicates the type of algorithm that was used, as well as my implementation of that algorithm designed to maximize the utility function.

Notice that the folder 'hard' also contains following files:

- `plotted_function.py` (plot of the utility function)
- `calculation_partial_derivative.txt` (calculation of the partial derivative in respect to the power parameter)

## Prerequisites

Following libraries are required:

- mathplotlib
- numpy

## Running the Code

To run any of the optimization files:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Change the directory to the folder of the desired difficulty level using `cd <foldername>`.
3. Execute the script with the following command:

`python <filename>.py`

Feel free to delve into the folders, explore the various approaches, and see how the algorithms perform. Happy optimizing!
